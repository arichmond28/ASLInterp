ASL Intepreter

*In very early development stage*

I am currently working on a Beta 1.0 version of ASLInterp which will consist
of a simple image classification program to translate ASL signs into english
text.

The application can be run using (streamlit run translator.py), and when deployed,
I will include the link to the application in this README.

*Future Goals*

Work to support videos as well as work to generalize to avoid overfitting. This
will all be a part of the continuous development phase that will follow Beta 1.0.
